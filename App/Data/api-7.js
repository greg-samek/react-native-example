["Princess Kate made it a Pancake Day to remember for families of sick kids at a London children’s hospital on Tuesday. The 35-year-old mother of two toured the Ronald McDonald House near Evelina London Children’s Hospital on Shrove Tuesday – “Fat Tuesday” in the U.S., but widely known as Pancake Day in the U.K. She toured the 59-bedroom house that provides comfort, support and a safe environment for families while their sick children are treated at the hospital. She chatted with the families as they made pancakes. Kate wore a blue skirt suit with small, silver threading, by New York designer Rebecca Taylor as she took to the facility run by Ronald McDonald House Charities, which provides support and comfort for the families of children battling serious illness. It’s just a five-minutes walk from the Evelina children’s hospital in Lambeth, London. An 8-year-old named Isabelle, whose 6-year-old brother is a patient at the hospital, graced Kate with a bouquet of flowers as she arrived at the hospital, according to a tweet from Kensington Palace. The royal mom played with an 8-month-old baby girl named Mia, who has been at the hospital for more than seven months, palace officials tweeted. The home is equipped with kitchens, playrooms  and laundry facilities — it even has communal lounges so that families feel at home.

The visit comes less than a day after the princess wore sparkling, Cinderella-style heels at an Indian-U.K. cultural event at the palace alongside  Queen Elizabeth and her husband Prince William."]
